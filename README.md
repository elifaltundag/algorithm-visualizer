# [Algorithm Visualizer](https://ts-algorithm-visualizer.netlify.app/)


## About the Project
When studying algorithms, understanding how they work (their magic), if the information is put in words, can be tricky and/or time-consuming at first. By visualizing how algorithms operate, we can ease and accelerate this learning process.

### Purpose 
Make understanding basic algorithms in computer science (search, sort and traversal) easier through visualization. 


## Functionalities
* Compare linear and binary search algorithms
* Compare breadth-first and depth-first traversal algorithms
* Analyze various sort algorithms 


## Technologies
* TypeScript
* React.js
* SASS / SCSS
* Git & GitHub
* Netlify 


## Project Status: On-going
